We've tried to make our language *explicit* where possible. Implicit behavior requires [[Familiarity|familiarity]] with the underlying concepts, so by being explicit we aim to help the user navigate through possible ambiguity.

This doesn't mean we are pushing for needless repetition — there are many higher-order functions and sugar syntax at play for making things explicit without being redundant.
