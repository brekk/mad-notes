- `#iftarget` syntax is used to specify code which is reliant on a specific ecosystem / target.
- Code _should_ be written to be portable across all-targets by default:
	- JS / web code uses `#iftarget js`
	- LLVM code uses `#iftarget llvm`
	- This may vary based upon intent â€” but all core Madlib code should have parity across both targets
- Code which uses [[DX - The Fence|The Fence]] should be written within `#iftarget js`
- Code which uses [[DX - Externally linked libraries|externally linked libraries]] should be written within `#iftarget llvm`
