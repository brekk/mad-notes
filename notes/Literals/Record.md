##### Synopsis
- Records offer a syntactic means of expressing a container type that has fields of differing types, delimited by single curly braces: `{` ... `}`. It is designed to pair well with the [[Dot Property shorthand]]. It is similar but distinct from a [[Dictionary]], which has a slightly different syntax and whose fields must be of the same type. Records pair well with [[Aliases|alias]] syntax in order to reference a complex type by a domain-specific name.
