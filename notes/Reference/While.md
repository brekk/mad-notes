Much of Madlib follows functional programming principles and uses `map` to transform lists of values or some kind of logical fold like `reduce`.

Madlib has a specific syntax to afford a distinctly imperative pattern, the `while` loop. It pairs specifically with [[Do Notation]] and the [[Explicit Mutation Operator]].
