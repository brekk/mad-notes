##### Synopsis
- Madlib has C-style comments which start with two slashes: (`//`) for single-lines or wrapped with (`/*` … `*/` ) for multi-line comments. Additionally there is a special format for creating comments which can be automatically parsed and turned into structured JSON — and a secondary tool which can then turn this JSON into a website.
