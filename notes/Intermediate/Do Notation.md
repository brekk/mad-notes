##### Synopsis
- The `do` keyword allows for some specific semantics: for values which are monadic it will automatically unwrap a type (and allows for the usage of the [[single assignment operator]]) in other contexts it allows for multiple expressions in a space which otherwise expects a single expression, like [[Conditionals|if ... then]] and [[Pattern Matching|pattern matching using where]].
