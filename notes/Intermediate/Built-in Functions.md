##### Synopsis
- There are a few built-in functions which are globally available and do not need to be imported. They are created at a level that allows them to be leveraged by other core functionality in Prelude but in this respect they are inconsistent with other modules which require explicit imports. They are also slightly different than syntactic keywords.
