##### Synopsis
- Instances are a means of defining an contract of behavior for all [[Algebraic Data Types|data types]] which implement the contract.

In some languages these are akin to an abstract superclass; in Haskell these are nearly identical to (and based upon) a [type class](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Classes_and_types).
